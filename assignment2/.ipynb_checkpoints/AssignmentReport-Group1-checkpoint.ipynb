    "The improved model has some obivous benfits. Even with alpha set to 0.02 for the improved model versus 0.1 for the model from task 2, there is an big increase in the speed of learing, therefor the early stopping hits in sooner. With fast learining it converges way faster. There are some signs of over on both models. As the training accuracy is almost 1 for both. Also the accuray and loss graph between training and validation becomes futher apart in both cases. Resuceing early stopping might help.\n",
